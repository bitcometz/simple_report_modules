T0:"Background"
P0:"With the development of long-read sequencing technologies, single-molecule sequencing platforms(Pacific Biosciences) and nanopore-based platforms(Oxford Nanopore Technology) can sequence long DNA fragments and provide long reads that could be used in de novo whole-genome assembly. Using efficient algorithms, these methods could provide high-quality assemblies in terms of contiguity and completeness of repetitive regions."
P0:"With de novo sequencing, the genome map for a species could be generated, providing a valuable reference sequence for phylogenetic studies, analysis of species diversity, mapping of specific traits and genetic markers, and other genomics research."

T0:"Oxford Nanopore Sequencing"
P0:"Oxford Nanopore technology is developing nanopore based sensing technologies for the analysis of biology molecules like DNA, RNA and protein. At the heart of the technology is a protein nanopore. In Oxford nanopore technology, the nanopore is inserted into a membrane created by synthetic polymer that has very high electrical resistance. By applying a potential across the membrane which is bathed in electrochemical solution an ionic current can be generated through the nanopore. Single molecules that enter the nanopore caused characteristic disruptions in the current. By measuring that disruption the molecule can be identified."

P0:"PromethION platform is the high-throughput and high-sample number benchtop system which is suitable for large scale projects such as population-scale sequencing or plant genomics, or for large scale service offerings."

T0:"DNA Quantification & Qualification"
P0:"1)	DNA degradation and contamination were examined on 1% agarose gels."
P0:"2)	DNA purity was checked using the NanoPhotometer® spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA)."
P0:"3)	DNA concentration was measured using Qubit® DNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA)."
P0:"4)	DNA size was examined on pulse field electrophoresis."

T0:"Illumina DNA Library preparation"
P0:"Total amount of 1.0μg DNA per sample was used as input material for library preparations with NEBNext® DNA Library Prep Kit following manufacturer's recommendations and indices were added to each sample. The genomic DNA is randomly fragmented to size of 350bp, and then DNA fragments were end polished, A-tailed, and ligated with the NEBNext adapters of Illumina sequencing, and further PCR enriched with primers of P5 and P7 oligos. The PCR products as final construct of the libraries were purified (AMPure XP system), followed by quality control test that included size distribution by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and molarity measurement using real-time PCR. The flowchart below depicts the workflow of library preparation."
F0:"data/hic.figure3.lib.png","Figure 2.2 Library Construction Workflow"

T0:"Nanopore DNA Library preparation"
P0:"As shown in the figure 4.2, the first step in the generation of a 1D library is production of appropriately-sized double-stranded DNA fragments. These fragments can be generated by random shearing of DNA, or by amplification of target regions of interest. The 1D library itself is produced by ligating adapters onto double-stranded DNA fragments. Adapter dimers are also efficiently removed using AMPure XP beads. After the AMPure XP purification steps, the prepared library is loading into the flow cell."

T0:"Sequencing"
P0:"Pair-end sequencing was performed on Illumina® NovaSeq platform, with the read length of 150 bp at each end. Oxford Nanopore sequencing was performed on PromethION."

T0:"Wtdbg2 algorithm"
P0:"Wtdbg was used for assembly, here is the procedure of the algorithms."
P0:"&nbsp;(1) During assembly, wtdbg2 chops reads into 1024bp segments, merges similar segments into a vertex and connects vertices based on the segment adjacency on reads. Wtdbg2 groups 256 base pairs into a bin, a small box in the figure. Bins/boxes with the same color suggest they share k-mers. Current read overlappers split input reads into many smaller batches and perform all-vs-all alignment between batches."
P0:"&nbsp;(2) Wtdbg2 identifies equivalent segments based on their alignments and connects these segments if they are connected on the input reads. Information on reads going through each edge is kept in the graph (colored edges)."
P0:"&nbsp;(3) In the fuzzy-Bruijn assembly graph, a vertex is a bin segment. After graph construction, wtdbg2 trims tips and pops bubbles and produces the final contig sequences from the consensus of read subsequences attached to each edge."
P0:"&nbsp;(4) The result of the step on the assembly, the use of the three generations of data based on the result of the assembly Racon software."

Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier. Line 4 encodes the sequencing quality for each base in line 2, and contain the same number of characters as bases in line 2."
S0:"data/hic.table3.identifier.txt","Table 4.1 Information of Illumina sequence identifiers"
P0:"Raw data obtained from sequencing contains adapter contamination and low-quality reads. These sequencing artifacts may increase the complexity of downstream analyses, and therefore, we utilize quality control steps to remove them. Consequently, all the downstream analyses are based on the clean reads."
P0:"The quality control steps are as follows:"
P0:"&nbsp;(1) Discard a read pair if either one read contains adapter contamination;"
P0:"&nbsp;(2) Discard a read pair if more than 10% of bases are uncertain in either one read;"
P0:"&nbsp;(3) Discard a read pair if the proportion of bases of low quality is over 50% in either one read."
P0:"Consistent with the Illumina platform sequencing features, for PE data, the error rate required to be below 0.1%. The results are shown in Table 4.3."

T0:"Nanopore long-read de novo assembly"
P0:"WTDBG2建议采取50x深度的数据来进行组装，因此程序会挑选最长的~60x数据。程序里面的其他参数都是根据~50x的数据深度来进行设置的，数据输入太多，反而会造成其他参数设置不准确。"
